Prayer request management system

* A Meteor web-app et al for cataloging prayer requests.
* Requests may contain a category, a name, a location, an image url, and/or a date.  In addition each gets an arbitrary number & color assigned and a creation timestamp.
* When reviewing requests they are displayed in groups.  When clicked the details are shown.  Reviewing a verse makes it appear higher in the list.

So be it...
